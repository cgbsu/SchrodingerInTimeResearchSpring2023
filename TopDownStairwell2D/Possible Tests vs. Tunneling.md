# Possible Tests: 
## Tunneling Time/Flux/Probability vs. "Shave" Top Down Time: 
    - Tunnel as wide as stairwell is high?
    - Tunnel as wide as first two staris are high
    - Cubic stairwell (remove debate)
    - Reflected wave time vs. output
    - Put stairwell in free space measure tunneling time on each region of stairwell in Y direction vs "shave" time (try with cubic first two and all 3 stairs)
## Free Particle vs. Top Down
    - Test control traveling in orthagonal direction same distance as height vs. "shave"

# Fundimental Questions: 
    - Do we want the particle to end up on the third stair, or after it?
